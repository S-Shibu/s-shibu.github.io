<b>What makes “Doom Eternal” good?</b>
Doom Eternal was revolutionary when it first came out, and is still highly regarded as one of the best games in the FPS genre. A few reasons it was so popular amongst wide groups of audiences was its gameplay mechanics, its level design, and its music/sound design. Intricate and complex yet clear and motivating was the core of the game’s ideals. The game keeps you coming back to finish it or 100% it, and has an almost never-ending combat loop.

<b>What are the best games within the FPS Genre?
</b>
Some exceptionally well made FPS games include "Half-Life 2" for its innovative physics gameplay and storytelling, the predecessor to Doom Eternal; “DOOM (2016)” for its intense combat and level design, and "BioShock" for its narrative and setting.

<b>What are the worst games within the FPS Genre?
</b>
Some FPS games have fallen short due to issues like clunky and hard to learn controls, poor NPC routine, and bugs. "Ride to Hell: Retribution" stands as a notable example with its unpolished mechanics and storytelling, and "Aliens: Colonial Marines” disappointed fans due to its bad graphics and gameplay mechanics. It is rare for a FPS game to be developed as badly as these were.

<p style="text-align:center;">This would be a good computer for me because it is capable of basically anything. I could produce music, use adobe apps without them crashing, and play any game on the planet with about 240 fps. I would have 8 TBs of storage on SSD's alone, so I could play around with different OS's, have an insanely large game library, and virtually anything else I want. Plus the computer looks very cool. I also have 4 monitors, one for msg'ing, one for gaming, one for videos/movies, and one for miscellaneous activities on a browser. This case also makes maintenance very easy, and upgrades (IF I would ever need to upgrade) accessible. I would have no limitations hardware wise.
